 EMERALD’S KILLFEED — PROJECT BOOTSTRAP & STARTUP VALIDATION PROMPT

🧩 TASK TYPE: SINGLE TASK (FULL SETUP AND STARTUP)

> This task must be executed as a single atomic operation.
No commits, checkpoints, or logs may be triggered until all steps complete and the bot is confirmed running and fully operational.

# [PHASE 0] — UNZIP, CONFIGURE, START, VALIDATE

🗂️ 1. Unzip Project Archive

Detect and unzip the uploaded .tar.gz or .zip from attached_assets

If the archive extracts into a subfolder (e.g. project/, bot/), move all contents into the project root directory

Delete any empty folders, duplicates, or symbolic links

Result: All source files, assets, configs, and folders should be accessible from root



---

🔐 2. Inject Required Secrets

Use Replit's environment variables UI to load the following:

BOT_TOKEN — your Discord bot token

MONGO_URI — MongoDB connection string

TIP4SERV_KEY — (Optional: only if premium system is active)

RAILWAY_ENV — (Optional: for Railway-specific flags or logging)


Ensure all secret variables are loaded via os.environ — no use of .env files or local secret JSONs.


---

🚀 3. Start the Bot in Production Mode

Start the bot by executing start.py, main.py, or equivalent entrypoint

Confirm production mode is active (if the bot supports multiple modes)

Monitor console output for:

Cog loading

Slash command sync

Database connection

Discord gateway handshake




---

🧯 4. Detect and Resolve All Errors (Critical)

If startup fails or throws errors:

Capture and analyze full stack trace

Resolve the root cause — no hotpatching or retry loops

Fix:

Failed imports

Syntax errors

Missing directories or assets

SFTP/mongo connection issues

Invalid secrets or schema mismatches


Restart and re-test after every fix



---

✅ 5. Confirm Successful Startup

The bot is considered successfully running when the following are met:

Logs: Bot connected to Discord as...

All cogs/modules are loaded and confirm via logging

Slash commands synced successfully (with no Discord rate limit warnings)

MongoDB and SFTP connectivity confirmed

No runtime errors, unresolved exceptions, or abnormal terminations

Bot stays online and operational



---

🚨 EXECUTION RULES (STRICT)

✅ Execute all steps in one uninterrupted batch

🚫 Do not trigger logs, commits, or checkpoints until all validation is passed

✅ Use only py-cord 2.6.1 — remove and reject any discord.py remnants

✅ Validate startup via logs, not assumptions

⚠️ Test functionality before declaring success — do not assume a clean compile = correct behavior
